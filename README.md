# daux.io Docker Image

Daux.io docker image with additional WebHook endpoint to update documentation from Gitlab.  This was originally taken from this [blog post](http://gh-blog.mybluemix.net/blogs/cokeSchlumpf/rethink-it/posts/projects/daux-io-docker.md) and [Github repo](https://github.com/cokeschlumpf/daux.io).  It was modified to use Gitlab webhook syntax and fixed to install the daux.io dependencies.  

The latest build can be found on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/is4s/daux.io).

    docker pull is4s/daux.io
